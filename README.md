Picnic Portal  is a one-stop application for registering people who want to come for a picnic.It makes managing things easier.
The application uses Java, Hibernate and Junit( for all the test cases) on the backend side.
On the frontend side , I have used HTML5, Javascript and BootStrap.

Currently, the application can create new records and update them. 
I will add the funtionality of deleting entries soon.

Happy Coding! :)
